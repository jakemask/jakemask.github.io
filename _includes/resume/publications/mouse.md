I worked with Ben Ellis, James Mouradian, and Hovav Shacham to demonstrate an
end to end firmware exploitation of a gaming mouse. Although many users are aware
of the threats that malware pose, users are unaware that malware can infect
peripheral devices. Many embedded devices support firmware update capabilities, yet
they do not authenticate such updates; this allows adversaries to infect peripherals
with malicious firmware. We present a case study of the Logitech G600 mouse,
demonstrating attacks on networked systems which are also feasible against
air-gapped systems.
