I am currently enrolled in the five-year BS/MS program, and plan to finish my
graduate study in Winter 2016. I completed my undergraduate study as a Computer
Science major in Winter 2015.  I was a recipient of the Jacobs Engineering
Scholarship, which is a full scholarship (tuition, housing, food, books, etc.)
awarded to only eleven students in my class.
