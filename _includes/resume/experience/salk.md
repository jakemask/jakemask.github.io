**June 2010 - December 2011** - *matlab, maximally-informative-dimensions, statistical-analysis*

I was selected out of hundreds of applicants to work in the Computational
Neurobiology Lab, under Dr. Tatyana Sharpee as part of the Salk High School
Scholars program. I worked in Matlab processing large amounts of visual,
auditory, and neural data, and then ran various algorithms on the data. My
project was to participate in the UC Berkeley Neural Prediction Challenge, using
our lab's neural analysis algorithm, Maximally Informative Dimensions (MID) to
predict neural response to natural stimuli. After completing this project, I
worked to prepare various data sets for further analysis by my team's
researchers.
