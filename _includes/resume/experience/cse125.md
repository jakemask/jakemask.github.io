#### Engine Developer - *5 Second Rule*

**April 2014 - June 2014** - *graphics, networking, game engines*

In spring quarter of my third year at UC San Diego, I enrolled in the CSE 125:
Software System Design and Implementation course. My 7 student team 5 Second
Rule, spent 10 weeks building *Vein: Rivers of Blood*, a 3D networked real-time
multiplayer video game without the use of any game engines or large libraries. I
was responsible for overall engine architecture, graphics, and some gameplay. At
the end of the quarter, I presented our game to professors, friends, and family
at a large final event.
