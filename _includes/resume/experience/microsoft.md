As part of Windows Azure's move to a more distributed API management system, I
worked with the Core Runtime team to create a data replication consistency
checking tool. This tool verifies that internal subscription data was properly
replicated across various data centers. This tool was integrated into the code
base as both a single-subscription troubleshooting tool and a long-running
process that can generate quality of service reports.
