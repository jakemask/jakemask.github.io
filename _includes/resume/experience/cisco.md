**June 2012 - September 2012** - *ruby, selenium-webdriver, objective-c, iOS, oracle, sql*

I worked as an engineering intern for Cisco in the summer of 2012 in the Cloud
Collaboration Application Technology Group on the WebEx Meetings Collaboration
system. In addition to fixing various Oracle database issues in the on-premise
version of the system, I developed a series of black box UI tests using Ruby and
the Selenium framework, and then went on to develop the prototype iOS
application for our product.
