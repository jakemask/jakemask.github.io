**June 2014 - September 2014** - *graphics, multiplayer, xbox one, game engines*

I worked on the Xbox HEMI team to integrate Xbox Live Compute, the platform
running dedicated servers on Azure for games such as Forza 5 and Titanfall, into
leading game engines. As part of this integration effort, I worked closely with
first party game developers such as Lionhead on their game Fable: Legends, and
third party engine developers such as Epic on their Unreal Engine 4.
Additionally, I worked on graphics features, such as a depth of field effect
using compute shaders, and optimized them for Xbox One.
