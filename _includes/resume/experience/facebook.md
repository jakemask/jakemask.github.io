**May 2016 - present** - *product security, cryptography, authentication*

As part of Facebook's Security Infrastructure team, I've worked on developing
and maintaining frameworks to make building applications and services at
Facebook "secure by default". I've worked on our privacy frameworks, our
cryptography services, and our code signing tooling, among other things.
