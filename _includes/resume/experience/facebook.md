##### Software Engineer, Secure Application Frameworks

*application security, product infrastructure, privacy*

Facebook's Secure Application Frameworks team develops and maintains frameworks to make building applications and services at Facebook "secure by default". I work on our authentication/privacy frameworks, and the developer experience of setting up new applications in our infrastructure (with secure defaults). I also lead our privacy incident management program through the incident management oncall rotation and the incicident review process.


##### Software Engineer, Core Infra Security

*authentication, cryptography*

The Core Infra Security team maintains Facebook's cryptographic infrastructure, including our internal certificate authority and cryptography services and libraries. I was the primary maintainer of our application signing service, which manages keys and signing for user-facing applications as well as internal packages and device firmware.


##### Security Engineer, Product Security

*application security, web security, privacy*

As part of the Product Security team, I worked on security code/design reviews for many products, including Messenger Secret Conversations (end-to-end encryption). I also built and maintained tooling for our bug bounty program.
