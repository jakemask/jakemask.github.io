#### Front End Developer - *Variable Action*
{: #variableaction}

**August 2011 - June 2012** - *php, mysql, javascript*

I was hired in Summer 2011 part time to help develop sites in Variable Action's
content management system, Zesty. My job was to develop brand new
Zesty websites, and to convert existing websites to Zesty. I worked with PHP and
MySQL on a remote server and focused on page load times and site usability. I also
helped maintain the Zesty Front End and its documentation to make sure that new
developers could learn the system quickly.
