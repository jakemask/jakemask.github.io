#### Front End Developer - *Variable Action*
{: #variableaction}

**August 2011 - June 2012** - *php, mysql, javascript*

I was hired in Summer 2011 part time to help develop sites in Variable Action's
innovative content management system, Zesty. My job is to develop brand new
Zesty websites, and to convert existing websites to Zesty. I work with PHP and
MySQL on a remote server and focus on page load times and site usability. I also
help maintain the Zesty Front End and its documentation to make sure that new
developers can learn the system quickly.
