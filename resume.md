### Experience

#### Software Development Engineering Intern - *Microsoft*

**June 2013 - September 2013** - *windows, azure, .net, c#*

As part of Windows Azure's move to a more distributed API management system, I
worked with the Core Runtime team to create a data replication consistency
checking tool. This tool verifies that internal subscription data was properly
replicated across various data centers. This tool was integrated into the code
base as both a single-subscription troubleshooting tool and a long-running
process that can generate quality of service reports.

#### Summer Engineering Intern - *Cisco Systems*

**June 2012 - September 2012** - *ruby, selenium-webdriver, objective-c, iOS, oracle, sql*

I worked as an engineering intern for Cisco in the summer of 2012 in the Cloud
Collaboration Application Technology Group on the WebEx Meetings Collaboration
system. In addition to fixing various Oracle database issues in the on-premise
version of the system, I developed a series of black box UI tests using Ruby and
the Selenium framework, and then went on to develop the prototype iOS
application for our product.

#### Front End Developer - *Variable Action*

**August 2011 - June 2012** - *php mysql javascript*

I was hired in Summer 2011 part time to help develop sites in Variable Action's
innovative content management system, Zesty. My job is to develop brand new
Zesty websites, and to convert existing websites to Zesty. I work with PHP and
MySQL on a remote server and focus on page load times and site usability. I also
help maintain the Zesty Front End and its documentation to make sure that new
developers can learn the system quickly.

#### Lab Assistant - *The Salk Institute for Biological Studies*

**June 2010 - December 2011** - *matlab, maximally-informative-dimensions, statistical-analysis*

I was selected out of hundreds of applicants to work in the Computational
Neurobiology Lab, under Dr. Tatyana Sharpee as part of the Salk High School
Scholars program. I worked in Matlab processing large amounts of visual,
auditory, and neural data, and then ran various algorithms on the data. My
project was to participate in the UC Berkeley Neural Prediction Challenge, using
our lab's neural analysis algorithm, Maximally Informative Dimensions (MID) to
predict neural response to natural stimuli. After completing this project, I
worked to prepare various data sets for further analysis by my team's
researchers.


### Education

#### B.S. Computer Science - *University of California, San Diego*

**Class of 2015** - *Data Structures, Algorithms, Programming Languages, Operating Systems, Compilers, Security*

I currently have senior standing in my third year as a Computer Science major
in Warren College. I have received the Jacobs Engineering Scholarship, which is
a full ride scholarship (tuition, housing, food, books, etc.) held by only 11
students in my class.
